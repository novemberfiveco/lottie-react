**Note** this project is a fork of https://github.com/Gamote/lottie-react and uses lottie-web light (which does not support action script animations). Additionally prop-types have been removed and some cleanup is done in regards of the typings. Functionality is exactly the same.

This project is meant to give developers full control over **[Lottie](https://airbnb.design/lottie/)** instance with minimal implementation by wrapping **[lottie-web](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-web)** in a Component or Hook that can be easily used in **React** applications.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have the peer-dependencies installed: `react` and `react-dom`.

    > _**Note:** This library is using React Hooks so the **minimum** version required for both **react** and **react-dom** is **v16.8.0**._

Install **lottie-react** using npm:

```text
npm i @novemberfiveco/lottie-react-light
```

## Usage

### Using the component ([try it](https://codesandbox.io/s/lottie-react-component-2k13t))

```js
import Lottie from "@novemberfiveco/lottie-react-light";
import groovyWalkAnimation from "./groovyWalk.json";

const App = () => <Lottie animationData={groovyWalkAnimation} loop={true} />;

export default App;
```

### Hook

```js
import { useLottie } from "@novemberfiveco/lottie-react-light";
import groovyWalkAnimation from "./groovyWalk.json";

const App = () => {
  const options = {
    animationData: groovyWalkAnimation,
    loop: true
  };

  const { View } = useLottie(options);

  return <>{View}</>;
};

export default App;
```
